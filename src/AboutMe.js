				{/*<p>Welcome!</p>
				<p>I have been interested in machine learning since I took a course in natural language processing my senior year of undergrad. After graduation, I spent some free time pursuing MOOCs, first in computer vision and then in machine learning itself. As I continued to learn about the field, I began to view it more and more as a way to make a huge impact on the world. Naturally, I feel in love with it as a potential career.</p>
				<p>After much deliberation, I decided to pursue a Master of Science education in Computer Science with an emphasis on machine learning, data mining, and artificial intelligence. As I begin to wrap up, I am starting to look at opportunities to apply machine learning solutions to a wide range of problems. This webpage is meant to showcase my experiences and projects.</p>

				I'm a Master of Science in Computer Science student at the University of Minnesota (currently based in Seattle) with two years of full-stack web experience. I'm passionate about machine learning and artificial intelligence, and am excited about opportunities to use them in a socially responsible way to solve some of the toughest problems out there.
